## Happiness Description (2020)
The purpose of this project is to predict the happiness score of a country. The happiness score is determined by the 2017 world happiness report. There are two models, a **regression** and **classification model**. I use a **support vector machine** for a classifications and a **penalized ridge regression**. The variables descriptions and sources are in the file *happiness_variables* file.


**RMSE** is used to validate the regression and **accuracy** is used to validate the classification model. Other metrics derived from the **confusion matrix** are included as well. A residual analysis is at the end of the markdown file.

## Abortion Survey Description (2019)
This school project is a classification meant to understant/predict people that would vote to ban/permit abortion. The dataset is from the 2011 Canadian National Election Study by York University. Methods of unsupersived learning such as, **association rules** and **clustering** are used to explore the relationship between charateristics and a person's stance. A **Neural Network** model predict an individual's vote. *AbortionSurvey_variables* has the descriptions of the variables and the data preprocessing.
