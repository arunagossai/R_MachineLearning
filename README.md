## Happiness Description (2020)
The purpose of this project is to predict the happiness score of a country. 
The happiness score is determined by the 2017 world happiness report. 
There are two models, a **regression** and **classification model**.
I use a **support vectors machine** for a classifications and a **penalized ridge regression**.

**RMSE** is used to validate the regression and **Accuracy** is used to validate the classification model. 
Other metrics derived from the **confusion matrix** are included as well. 
A residual analysis is at the end of the markdown file.
